Utagawa Hiroshige (1797-1858) Bingo Province: Abuto, Kannon Temple (Bingo, Abuto, Kannondo) 
Edo period, 19th centurywoodblock print, from the series Famous Places in the Sixty-odd Provinces (Rokujuyoshu meisho zue), signed Hiroshige hitsu (Brush of Hiroshige), censor's seal aratame (certified), published by Koshimuraya Heisuke, block cutter's mark Hori Take (Yokokawa Takejiro), 12th month 1853, first state
Vertical oban: 35.9 x 24.1 cm. The Kannon Temple of Abuto stands on stilts at the edge of a rocky promontory. A hazy full moon peaks through the clouds; two boatman drift along the waters silhouetted in the misty dark. It is thought that Hiroshige based this design on an earlier illustration by Fuchigami Kyokko (d. 1833) in the album Remarkable Landscape Views (Sansui kikan, 4 vols., 1800). This is the first state with clouds printed in the sky, and the rockwork sensitively rendered. A similar impression of the first state is in the collection of the British Museum, museum number 1902,0212,0.397.19",Bingo.jpg
